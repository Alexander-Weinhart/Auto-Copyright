# Auto-Copyright

Auto-Copyright is a simple vanilla JavaScript template that inserts into an HTML/CSS/JS project. This little script has been in my repetoire the two years i've been designing websites, and it generates professional and correct copyrights. The copyrights auto-update every new year to keep current, and they fit copyright standards. This code has also been server tested with the 2024-2025 new year on my public websites.
